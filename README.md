# wine-rvfl

Multi-layer adaptation of the Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) network using gradient-free target propagation for training and Hyperdimensional Computing encoding methods for data representation. Experiment with gradient-free HD computing techniques to do classification on edge devices/neuromorphic hardware.

Trained and tested on the [3-class "Wine" dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine) and MNIST.
